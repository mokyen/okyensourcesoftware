This approach streamlines the development process, especially for personal projects or when you need a quick, sharable testing setup.</p>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Compiler Explorer (CE), also known as godbolt.org, has been a game-changer for many software engineers, myself included. Over the past four years, it has significantly impacted my development process. This tool's influence extends beyond individual developers; even tech giants like Google incorporate CE <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=torqlZnu9Ag\">into their official processes</a>. The C++ community (and many others) owes a debt of gratitude to <a href=\"https://xania.org/\">Matt Godbolt</a> for creating this invaluable resource.</p>\n<p>One of CE's most powerful applications is in learning how to perform Test Driven Development (TDD). Previously, setting up a TDD environment could take hours. With CE and some guidance from <a href=\"https://blog.feabhas.com/2020/08/tdd-with-compiler-explorer/\">Niall Cooling's blog</a>, I was able to start unit testing in under two minutes. This accessibility extends to various devices, from desktops to tablets, and even smartphones (though mobile usage has its limitations).</p>\n<p>While CE's Gtest integration works seamlessly for single-file projects, things get more complex when you need to separate source code and unit tests. This blog post will guide you through setting up Gtest with CMake in Compiler Explorer for multi-file projects, sharing insights from my experience and offering solutions to common challenges.</p>", "image": null, "date_published": "2024-09-18T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "mokyen"}], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://www.okyensourcesoftware.com/blog/decision-making-isolation-dmi/", "url": "https://www.okyensourcesoftware.com/blog/decision-making-isolation-dmi/", "title": "Decision-Making Isolation (DMI)", "content_html": "<h1>Decision-Making Isolation (DMI)</h1>\n<p>Decision-Making Isolation is a design philosophy that emphasizes separating the decision-making in code from the IO (gathe...</p>", "image": null, "date_published": "2024-06-16T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "mokyen"}], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://www.okyensourcesoftware.com/blog/what-is-invariance/", "url": "https://www.okyensourcesoftware.com/blog/what-is-invariance/", "title": "What is Invariance?", "content_html": "<h1>What is Invariance?</h1>\n<p>The term 'invariant' is one of the linchpins of Decision Making Isolation. It is used in the <a href=\"https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines\">Cpp Core Guidelines</a> as the reason to use a class versus struct. But what does it really mean?</p>\n<h2>Struct vs Class</h2>\n<p>Before we discuss invariance, let's take a look at what else the <a href=\"https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines\">Cpp Core Guidelines</a> say about the difference between a class and struct.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#c8-use-class-rather-than-struct-if-any-member-is-non-public\">C.8</a>: Use <code>class</code> rather than <code>struct</code> if any member is non-public\nReason: Readability. To make it clear that something is being hidden/abstracted. This is a useful <em>convention</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While <code>class</code> and <code>struct</code> are relatively equivalent in C++, the Guidelines set the <em>convention</em> that structs are intended to only contain public members. Because all public data members can be directly modified, I believe it can be inferred that structs also shouldn't have public member functions. In the forthcoming <a href=\"dmi.md\">Decision Making Isolation (DMI) blog</a>, we'll go more into the preference for free functions. For now, we'll assume that structs only have public data members and no functions.</p>", "image": null, "date_published": "2024-06-16T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "mokyen"}], "tags": null}]}
