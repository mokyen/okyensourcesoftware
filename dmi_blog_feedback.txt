Feedback to implement on DMI blog from C++ now presentation and slides via Claude:
Certainly! Here's a consolidated plan for polishing and structuring your blog post on Decision Making Isolation (DMI), incorporating elements from your presentation and the separate invariance article:

Introduction

Brief, engaging introduction setting the stage for DMI
Include the leaf-raking analogy to illustrate the challenge of balancing software design
Briefly describe your personal software journey


What is Quality Software?

Define quality software: "easy to read, modify, extend, and test"
Present this definition in a callout box or as a key takeaway


The SOLID Principles: Challenges with SRP and OCP

Briefly explain SRP and OCP
Discuss the difficulties in applying these principles
Use examples from your presentation to illustrate these challenges


Introducing Decision Making Isolation (DMI)

Present the DMI vision statement
List the three key guidelines of DMI in a visually appealing format
Explain how DMI addresses the challenges of implementing SRP and OCP


The Three Types of Code in DMI

Define and provide examples of decision-making, IO, and wiring
Use the "RequestHandler" example to show before and after DMI refactoring


Implementing DMI: A Practical Guide
a. Choosing between free functions, structs, and classes

Explain the preference for free functions
Discuss when to use structs vs. classes

b. Understanding invariance (link to full article)

Provide a brief summary of invariance
Mention the three categories of invariance
Emphasize its importance in deciding between classes and structs
Include a callout: "Use a class when your data contains an invariant; use a struct when data members can vary independently."

c. Component boundaries

Explain when to use classes for component boundaries
Clarify how this relates to or differs from invariance


DMI and Unit Testing

Explain the focus on testing decision-making code
Provide examples of unit tests before and after applying DMI
Discuss approaches for testing wiring and frameworks/drivers


DMI and the SOLID Principles Revisited

Explain how DMI helps fulfill SRP and OCP


Comparison with Other Approaches

Highlight what makes DMI unique
Compare with approaches like "Extract Method" and "Separation of Concerns"


A Design Process for Implementing DMI

Present your design process steps in a visual format (flowchart or numbered list)
Provide brief explanations for each step


Challenges and Considerations

Address common questions and concerns about DMI
Include examples of how to overcome these challenges


Conclusion and Call to Action

Recap the key points of DMI
Use the 5-point call to action from your presentation


FAQ Section

Include questions addressing common concerns, including one about invariance


Visual Elements

Add diagrams to illustrate key concepts (e.g., dinner decision flowchart)
Include simplified versions of diagrams from your presentation slides


Code Examples

Incorporate more code examples throughout the post
Ensure each example is accompanied by a brief explanation


References

Include all sources mentioned in your blog and presentation



This structure combines the depth of your original blog post with the clarity and additional examples from your presentation, while also effectively incorporating the separate invariance article. It should result in a comprehensive, engaging, and practical guide to Decision Making Isolation that readers can easily understand and apply.
