Here are the key elements from your presentation and slides that should be added to your blog draft:

1. The Vision Statement
```markdown
> The most important parts of our code are the places where we decide what should happen. If these decisions are isolated, that critical code is easy to read, modify, extend, and test. If those key decisions are implemented correctly, then we can feel confident that our code is trying to do what we expect it to do.
```

2. Personal Journey Section
- Add your background transitioning from mechanical engineering to robotics to software
- Include the "Cycle of Quality" concept where you repeatedly thought you understood quality software only to question everything again
- This helps establish credibility and makes the content more relatable

3. Decision-Making Examples
Add these practical examples from your presentation:
- Pizza order decision function
- "Should we go out to eat" decision function
- Energy level calculation algorithm
- These examples clearly demonstrate pure decision-making code

4. The Picky Eater Analogy
- Add the flowchart example showing how to separate dinner decision-making from the actual cooking
- Use this to illustrate the difference between decision-making and actions

5. Testing Section Improvements
Add these key points:
- The goal of testing is to build confidence that our software works
- Testing decisions is high value because it verifies what we're trying to do
- Include the comparison of test code before/after DMI showing how tests become simpler

6. Practical Guidance for Testing
Add sections on:
- How to test wiring code (focus on happy paths)
- How to test frameworks and drivers
- Why we don't need to test everything with unit tests

7. Component Boundaries Section
Add more detail about:
- How entities are grouped into components
- When to use a class at a component boundary
- Why these boundaries are exceptions to the invariance rule

8. Additional Code Examples
Add examples demonstrating:
- Before/after comparisons of applying DMI
- Test code comparisons
- Wiring examples

9. From Your Presentation Q&A
Add a FAQ section addressing:
- When to test both decisions and wiring
- How to handle complexity in wiring code
- Where to put free functions relative to the class they support

10. Call to Action
Add your five-point call to action:
1. Use the C++ Core Guidelines
2. Focus unit testing on value
3. Consider invariance when designing classes
4. Use more free functions
5. Try Decision-Making Isolation

11. What Makes DMI Unique
Add a section explaining how DMI differs from similar approaches:
- Contrast with "Extract Method" (Beck)
- Compare with "Separation of Concerns" (Iglberger)
- Emphasize that DMI makes this the default approach rather than a solution to a problem

These additions would help make your blog more comprehensive and practical, while maintaining the clear and engaging style you've already established.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these suggested additions?

Ah, now I understand! You have a complete invariance blog that should be integrated into this series. Let me revise the structure considering this:

### Post 1: "Introduction to Decision Making Isolation (DMI)"
Keep the introduction focused and engaging:
- Your personal journey
- Problems with current approaches (SRP/OCP challenges)
- Vision statement
- Brief overview of the three key principles
- Teaser mentioning that understanding invariance will be key
Length: About 1/4 of current content

### Post 2: "DMI Core Concepts: The Three Types of Code"
Focus on establishing core DMI concepts:
- Detailed explanation of decision making, IO, and wiring
- Simple example showing the three types
- Core Guidelines that support this approach
- Examples of identifying each type in real code
- End with a lead-in to why understanding invariance is crucial
Length: About 1/3 of current content

### Post 3: Your Existing Invariance Blog
- This becomes a natural bridge between understanding the basic concepts and implementing them
- Sets up the foundation for making decisions about classes vs free functions

### Post 4: "DMI in Practice: Component Design & Architecture"
Now builds on both DMI concepts and invariance understanding:
- Component boundaries
- Clean Architecture connections
- When/how to use ABCs
- Extended practical examples
- Design process walkthrough
Length: Similar to Post 2

### Post 5: "Testing with DMI"
Complete the series with testing strategy:
- Testing philosophy
- How to test each type of code
- Example test implementations
- Integration testing approach
Length: Slightly shorter than Posts 2/4

### Post 6: "DMI vs Other Principles and Philosophies"

This structure creates a natural progression:
1. Why DMI exists
2. Core concepts
3. Deep dive into invariance (crucial foundational concept)
4. Practical implementation
5. Testing approach

Would this flow work better with your existing invariance blog? I can adjust any part of this structure if needed.
