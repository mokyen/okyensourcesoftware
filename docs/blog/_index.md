# About the Blog

This site serves as a place for me to share some of my learnings and ideas on software development. Most of the blog focuses on my interests in C++, unit testing, software architecture/design, and medical device development.

I am hopeful that this blog gives an opportunity for engagement with others, so please reach out if you have any feedback!
