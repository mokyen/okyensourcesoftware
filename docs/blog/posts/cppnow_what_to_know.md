# C++Now: What to Know Before You Go

I am so excited that C++Now is just around the corner! Unfortunately, I won't be able to attend this year, but I wanted to share some insights from my previous experience to help first-timers and returning attendees prepare for this fantastic event. Here are my top 15 tips to make your C++Now experience even better:

## 🥾 Pack boots or good walking shoes for grass

Bring comfortable walking shoes that can handle going through grass. The walk from the hotels to the conference rooms takes about 10 minutes. There's a shortcut between conference venues that cuts through a field, so having shoes that can handle varied terrain is key, especially since the weather can be unpredictable. We even had snow last year!

## 🧥 Being a weatherproof jacket

Weather conditions can really vary at this time of year in Aspen. A rainproof jacket is definitely important, and layers are highly recommended. Temperatures can range from snowy conditions to relatively mild, so be prepared for anything.

## 🏊‍♂️ Check out the fitness center & pool

The resort's fitness facilities are awesome! I really enjoyed using the hot tub and going for a swim before my first conference talk. There's even an indoor basketball court if you need to burn off some energy between sessions.

## 🏢 The building "Bethe" is pronounced "Beta"

One of the conference rooms is called "Bethe" but it's actually pronounced "Beta." This can be confusing when you hear people talking about it if you don't know this ahead of time.

## 💺 Front row seating at the Lightning Talks is for speakers

I didn't know this initially and accidentally sat in the front where there were empty seats. It turned out those spots are reserved for speakers doing lightning talks. Fortunately, I was planning to do a lightning talk anyway!

## 💧 Bring along your Chapstick

The high elevation makes the air quite dry, so a good lip balm is essential. Your lips will thank you!

## 🍽️ Limited restaurant options in Aspen

Aspen is rather shut down during this time of year. The snow season is usually over, and the town goes a bit dormant before reopening for the warmer season. While we found some great food, options are limited, especially for people with dietary restrictions or allergies.

## 📦 Slow shipping to Aspen and limited stores

Amazon shipping to Aspen is slow, and there aren't many stores in town. I went looking for a belt last year and had a tough time finding one. Don't expect one-day shipping on forgotten items, so come prepared!

## 🚎 Take the shuttle service into town

There's a convenient shuttle that will take you into town and drops you off right in the heart of downtown Aspen. I definitely encourage you to explore the area—I found a great little bakery that was delicious and even enjoyed some gelato!

## 🍲 The on-site restaurant is quite good

I ended up eating at the resort restaurant rather than going into town most of the time. While it's not the cheapest option, they offer nice variety and quality food. I saved some cost by bringing along some snacks for breakfast in my room.

## 🛏️ Excellent resort accommodations

The rooms at the resort are super comfortable and spacious. They featured microwaves, basic dishes, and coffee makers. Mine even had two rooms! It's probably too late to book at the resort for this year, but I highly recommend staying on-site if you can for future events.

## 👥 Welcoming conference community

The C++Now attendees are incredibly welcoming if you want to join a group. I ended up getting "adopted" by a crew from Bloomberg last year, and it was a lot of fun. If you see people, don't just assume they're old friends who don't want to include anyone new. I initially felt uncomfortable approaching groups, but you should definitely go for it! The relationships and interactions are the best part of C++Now.

## ✈️ Weather impacts on Aspen flights

Flights in and out of Aspen can be significantly affected by weather conditions, so build in enough layover time if connecting through Denver. Avoid taking the last flight of the day if possible. We had snow on the ground when my plane was trying to land, and winds delayed my return flight. You really can't count on a short layover when traveling through Denver.

## 📊 Presentation slides available on Discord

Slides for the presentations are posted on Discord quite quickly, often even before the presentations begin. Many people take pictures of slides, but this isn't usually necessary. Instead, focus on the presentation and take notes. It can be valuable to jot down slide numbers for later reference, but you probably don't need to capture everything in the moment.

## 🎤 Supportive audience for speakers

If you're presenting at C++Now, remember that everyone wants you to succeed! The audience is there to learn and grow, not to challenge you or make you look bad. The C++ community at this conference is incredibly supportive and genuinely interested in what you have to share. Don't stress too much about your presentation—just have fun with it and enjoy sharing your knowledge with fellow enthusiasts!



Good luck to all the presenters, and I hope everyone has a wonderful time at this incredible event!
