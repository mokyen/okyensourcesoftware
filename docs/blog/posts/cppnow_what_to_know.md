TBD

Boots or good shoes for walking in grass 
waterproof jacket (Make this weather in general)
Fitness center & pool
Building is pronounced Beta
Sitting in front row is for speakers at lightning talks
chapstick 
Aspen is rather shut down so restaurant options are limited, especially for people with allergies 
Amazon shipping to Aspen is slow, and there aren't a lot of stores. 
there is a trolley that will take you into town 
the restaurant on site is quite good 
the rooms at the resort are awesome 
people are super welcoming if you want to join a group
flights in and out of Aspen really be impacted by the weather, so built in enough layover time in Denver and don't take the last flight
